
## To get the results in the paper:

* This section provides results of figure S10 - figure S12 in the Supplementary Material.

* Run S3_005.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.05.

* Run S3_01.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.1.

* Run S3_02.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S3_gm_new.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S3_gm_new_02.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S3_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure S10 and figure S11.

* Run S3_02_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure S12.

## Note:

* MXK_KBH_KBBH.R, MXK_KBH_KBBH_A005.R, MXK_KBH_KBBH_E.R, MXK_KBH_KBBH_E_A005.R, and Inverse.R are source files of Method 1 and Method 2.

* gm.R, GMtest067.R and GMtest.R are source files of the Gaussian Mirror method.

* gm_new.R, GMtest067_new.R and GMtest_new.R are source files of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold.
