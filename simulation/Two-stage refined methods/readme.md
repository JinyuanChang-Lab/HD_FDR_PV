
## To get the results in the paper:

* This section provides results of figure 3 in Section 4, figure S8 and figure S9 in the Supplementary Material.

* Run S4_origin.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S4_pre.R to get the results of two-stage refined Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S4_02.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2, two-stage refined Method 1 and Method 2, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S4_gm_new.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S4_gm_new_02.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S4_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure 3 and figure S8.

* Run S4_02_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure S9.
