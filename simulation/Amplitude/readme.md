
## To get the results in the paper:

* This section provides results of figure 2 in Section 5, figure S3 - figure S7 in the Supplementary Material.

* Run S2.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S2_02.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S2_gm_new.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S2_gm_new_02.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S2_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure 2 and figure S3.

* Run S2_02_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure S4.

* Run S2_other_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure S5 and figure S6.

* Run S2_other_02_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure S7.
