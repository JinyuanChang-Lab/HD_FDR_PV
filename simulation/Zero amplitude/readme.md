
## To get the results in the paper:

* This section provides results of figure 1 in Section 4, figure S1 and figure S2 in the Supplementary Material.

* Run S1_dim.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S1_dim_02.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Knockoff method and the Gaussian Mirror method with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S1_dim_gm_new.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.05 and 0.1.

* Run S1_dim_gm_new_02.R to get the results of the Gaussian Mirror method modified by FDP+ threshold with FDR level 0.2.

* Run S1_dim_plot.R to generate all subfigures of figure 1 and figure S1.

* Run S1_dim_plot_02.R to generate all subfigures of figure S2.
