## Data:

PI_DATA.txt

## To get the results in the paper:

* Run realdata.R to get the results of Method 1 and Method 2 in our paper, the Gaussian Mirror method, and the fixed-X Knockoff method.

* Run plot.R to get figure 5 in Section 5, figure S15 and figure S16 in the Supplementary Material.

## Note:

* gm.R implements the Gaussian Mirror method. Inverse.real.R is a source file of Method 1 and Method 2.
